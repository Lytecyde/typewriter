     We live in an action oriented society. It's been that way since we 
     <br>invented agriculture and developed a stable environment in which the 
     <br>tasks to be performed could be defined within. Not much thinking was 
     <br>needed. We have little experience of discussing and managing subjective,
     <br> internal states - although they are as much shared experiences as 
     <br>external objects visible to all. We have a general heuristic that says 
     <br>we should confine our observations to the externally visible, which 
     <br>kicks in to prevent the exploration of subjective phenomena even before 
     <br>they have had the chance to give results and justify themselves.<br>
